## Analysis of Electric Car Sharing
Autolib' is an electric car sharing service that  maintains a fleet of all-electric Bollor√© Bluecars for public use on a paid subscription basis, employing a citywide network of parking and charging stations.
We have been tasked to understand electric car usage by testing the hypothesis that the average for the top two postal codes with the most blue cars taken on weekdays is the same. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate the claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

This is a collaboratory notebook with the hypothesis tessting of the average bluecars taken  in the top two postal codes.
Null hypothesis : Average of blue cars taken in postal codes 75015 and 75016 is the same
Alternative hypothesis:Average of blue cars taken in postal codes 75015 and 75016 is different.
